## About

The UCLA LUG + ACM Capture the Flag event was held in Spring 2016 using the
[FBCTF](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf) platform. Teams of 1-3 people
competed to solve as many security-related challenges as possible in a 3 hour
timeframe. All of the challenges were custom designed by students for students.

## Format

The challenges were divided into two types: quizzes and flags.

__Quiz__ questions generally ask you to find certain pieces of information, for
instance, the IP address of a site or the open ports of a server. These can
usually be done relatively quickly, although some questions require clever
applications of tools in order to get what you want.

__Flag__ questions ask you to find a "flag", typically a random string of
alphanumeric characters, within a website, server, or binary executable. The
range and difficulty can be much higher; you may need to exploit a website to
hand you database credentials, or bruteforce a password file, or reverse
engineer an executable and extract its secrets.

Entering the correct answer/flag yielded points for the team. Hints could be
obtained for certain challenges at the cost of some points.
